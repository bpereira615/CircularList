600.226.02 CS226 Data Structures
Project 1 - CircularList

Files:
    List.java - a list interface, to be implemented using circular list
    CList.java - a circular, doubly linked list implementation
    CookingItemInterface.java - an interface for CookingItem
    CookingItem.java - represents an item at a given station
    CookingStationInterface.java - an interface for CookingStation
    CookingStation.java - represents a station in the kitchen
    SimDriver.java - a driver for Cutthroat Kitchen Sumulation

    infile.txt - input for simulation in text
    sim0.txt - simulation with removeThreshold = 0
    sim1.txt - simulation with removeThreshold = 1
    sim2.txt - simulation with removeThreshold = 2
    simP.txt - simulation with custom tend function

Comments:
    Our total penalty output does not seem to match with the expected
    values posted on the course site, perhaps an issue of where the
    simulation begins in the list or an off by 1 tick error?

    To get the various simulation file outputs, one must uncomment the
    code preceeding the simulate() function in SimDriver.   

NOTE:
    List, CookingItem, and CookingStation taken from course site
    CList.java adopted from DDList.java implementation on course site
